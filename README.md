# hello-world
Hugo's pratice
Hey this is Hugo here

### This is a markdown syntax to explain explain my implementation for my prep work project "aboutme"

**These are the steps of "Aboutme**

#####  1. First I was going to create a website more for about my start up community then I decide to modify and change it around to use it as my prepwork

#####  2. I decided to use bootstrap to make this as an amatuer because it will quicken up your process to make a website and you don't have to worry too much about the CSS

######    - about my vision, journey 

######    - mini photo gallery

######    - inspirational instagrammers

######    - table for my equiptments

######    - sign up form with functional registration

#####  3. Although its mainly about myself, i have also included a mini photo gallery of my photography work

#####  4.  i have included paragraph and sections about my vision and journey

#####  5.  then I made a card column to introduce to people about the instagramers that inspired me the most with a short description about themself

#####  6.   after the card column i created a a table/schedule about my essentail gear list about the equiptments that I used, i even put price after each equiptments

#####  7.  And finally at the bottom of my page, I have included a functional sign up form which includes registration form and payment details as well
